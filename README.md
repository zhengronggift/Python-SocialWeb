# At the prompt, the user should be able to login and register. For the register form, no restriction for username and password since the form does not ask for any personal informations, so anything with letters or numbers will work.
# Once register and login into the app, the user should be able to view messages and pictures, upload pictures, click like, post comments, change his/her own messages, and delete his/her own messages.

# Python-SocialWeb
# This web app is currently deployed on IBM Cloud Bluemix. Following is the link to the site:
# http://doodleweb.mybluemix.net/
# To run the code at local, go to hello.py, comment out app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=True), and use app.run(debug=True)
# At the prompt, the user should be able to login and register. For the register form, no restriction for username and password since the form does not ask for any personal information. 
# To register for an account, anything with letters or numbers will work. 
# Once log in the app, the user should be able to view messages and pictures, upload pictures, click like, post comments, change and delete his/her own comments, and change and delete his/her own posts.
